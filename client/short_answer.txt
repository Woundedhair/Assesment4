1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

A client is usually a software in te front-end part of the website that requests for services from a server while a server runs in the back-end and responds to requests made by the client due to stored data.

The client sends requests, the server sends responses.

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

It can be described as a path to a webpage and the name used in the URL to access endpoints.

-------------------
3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

//Correct order
- The user types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved.
